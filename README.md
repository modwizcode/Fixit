Fixit
=====

Fixit is a plugin to allow players to use the crafting grid to repair items.

Originally, before anvils, Minecraft players could not repair items conveniently and even
though the anvils have been added, this is a much more convenient way to keep your diamond items safe.
This revision of Fixit was forked as to make it possible to save enchantments and leather armor color.
